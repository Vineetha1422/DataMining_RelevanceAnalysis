# Reddit Comment Relevance Analysis: Rating Comments on a Scale of 1‚Äì5  

## üìå Overview  
**Problem**  
Reddit discussions often accumulate hundreds of comments, but many lack relevance to the original post. This project automatically rates comments on a **1‚Äì5 relevance scale** to address information overload and improve content moderation.  

**Impact**  
- Helps users focus on meaningful discussions  
- Streamlines moderation efforts  
- Enhances community engagement by surfacing high-quality content

## üîç Approach  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Used Reddit API to gather 10 posts with moderate comment engagement (limited by API restrictions).  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Removed spam, URLs, emojis, and deleted comments  
   - Applied TF-IDF vectorization to posts/comments  
3. **Embedding Hybridization**  
   - Combined **LDA** (topic modeling) with **MiniLM/BERT** (semantic embeddings)  
4. **Clustering**  
   - KMeans clustering into 5 groups (1‚Äì5 relevance scale)  
5. **Relevance Scoring**  
   - Custom metric

## üìä Results  
**Key Achievements**:  
- Hybrid models (LDA + MiniLM) achieved **clearer cluster separation** than standalone models  
- Example output for post *"Best iPhone 15 Pro Max color?"*:  
- **Cluster 2 (Score: 1.0)**: High-quality responses like *"I got white ‚Äì fingerprints barely visible"*  
- **Cluster 0 (Score: 0.0)**: Irrelevant/spam comments
